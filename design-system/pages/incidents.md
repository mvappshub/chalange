# Incidents Page Overrides

## Purpose
Triage-first incident list and detail workspace with strong AI action hierarchy.

## Overrides
- Severity and status always shown as colored badges.
- Detail page action priority:
  1. `Run AI triage` as primary.
  2. `Propose tasks` as secondary.
- Incident summary appears in a readable text block.
- IDs and timestamps use monospace.
- Timeline/audit snippets rendered as structured cards with bounded JSON blocks.
