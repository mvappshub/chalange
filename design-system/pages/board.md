# Board Page Overrides

## Purpose
Operational kanban with low-friction move/delete actions and strong scanability.

## Overrides
- Use 4 columns: `Todo`, `In Progress`, `Done`, `Remediation`.
- Column containers are card-like surfaces with muted headers.
- Card IDs use monospace and subdued contrast.
- Move/delete controls use compact button size to avoid admin-panel look.
- Card hover = subtle lift + border highlight (no scale jump).
