# Alerts Page Overrides

## Purpose
Fast alert creation with clear escalation path to incidents.

## Overrides
- "Create HIGH demo alert" must be the strongest CTA on page.
- Escalation action lives in a dedicated explanatory card.
- Watcher result (`created_incidents`) shown as success callout.
- Severity/status in table rendered as badges for quick triage.
- Keep creation and escalation sections visually distinct.
